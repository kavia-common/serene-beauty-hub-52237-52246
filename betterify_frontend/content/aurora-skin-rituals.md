Some evenings call for *less*. Less thinking, fewer steps, calmer products.

## The 7-minute reset

1. **Warm rinse (30s)** — let the water do the first half of the work.
2. **Gentle cleanse (60s)** — slow circles, soft pressure, no rush.
3. **Hydrate (60s)** — a thin layer, pressed in, not rubbed.
4. **Seal (30s)** — one final step to keep everything comfortable.

## A calm note

If your skin is tired, treat it like you would a friend: **warmth, softness, patience**.

> This is not medical advice—just a gentle reminder that consistency is kinder than intensity.
