You don’t need a big bathroom to feel like you have a spa—just a few cues that tell your body it’s safe to slow down.

## Checklist

- Dim one light (or use a lamp).
- Fill a glass of water.
- Put on something soft.
- Choose **one** product to focus on (mask *or* oil *or* moisturizer).

## A tiny ritual

Set a timer for **8 minutes** and do one thing slowly: apply a mask, moisturize, or massage your hands.

When the timer ends, stop. The goal is calm—not perfection.
