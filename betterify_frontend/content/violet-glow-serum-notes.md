This is a **quiet** serum: no drama, no tingle-chasing, just steady hydration.

## What I noticed

- Skin felt more comfortable by day 3.
- Makeup sat better (less texture emphasis).
- Glow looked more like *rest* than shine.

## How I used it

- AM: cleanser → serum → moisturizer → SPF
- PM: cleanser → serum → barrier cream

## What I’d change

If you’re pairing actives, keep the rest of the routine simple. The serum does its best work when the routine feels calm.

**Best for:** sensitive, dehydrated, “just want comfort” days.
